Heyhey people, Bronz here, and welcome to your very own slice of the infinite chaos of the multiverse, available at your fingertips. Just download and start rolling at your own leisure.

Feel free to use it however you like, either add your own entries, make your own list from scratch or just use the interface alone. You are free to use it on your own works and projects as long as give appropriate credits.

If you linked the Chaos Gacha when you use it and maybe mention me by name, I'd appreciate it. You could also just link one of my profiles on either Ao3, Questionable Questing or Webnovel which would be nice.

The current iteration of the Chaos Gacha features:

-79,985 Words of pure handwritten descriptions

-1,923 Unique Entries

-Freely adjustable odds

-Customizable Gacha Entries

And much more!

I will keep adding to the gacha and updating the interface as time goes and I am more than welcome for suggestions to add to the gacha because I am sure there are things in other media that I haven't watched, played or read that are great adds to the gacha yet I do not know, so suggestions about what to add to the gacha are more than welcome, especially those with descriptions.

Some mistakes might appear in the gacha considering its scale and considering this is the first release. If that is the case, simply report the problem and I will try my best to fix it.

There is a text file in the downloadable that contains all of the instructions on how to use the Gacha. 

That's all, enjoy your own slice of the endless chaos that is the Gacha.
